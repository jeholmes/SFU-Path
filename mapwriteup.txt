The map file was implemented using the Quartz 2D graphical API, part of the Core Graphics framework. The benefit of using Quartz 2D to implement the map is that it allowed us to easily draw lines ontop of the map to highlight the current path, and other useful graphical information that may be needed. The original map file was created as a single giant bitmap image using various SFU floor plans together to draw out the detailed portion of map for a couple of the buildings, along with maps of the campus to draw out the other surrounding buildings. Trying to load the one giant bitmap image into Quartz 2D proved to be troublesome, as iPhones only have so much memory and would crash trying to load the giant image. The solution was to implement the map with many image tiles using the CATiledLayer subclass of the CALayer class. Breaking the image up into 1760 tiles allowed Quartz 2D to only load in the tiles it needed at any given time during execution, the tiles in the current view frame. The result was a map that iPhones could handle with slick tile loading.
